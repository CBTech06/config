2020-02-13 20:12:24	captainchris	hello everybody 
2020-02-13 20:15:45	Pali	wabbits: so seems no :-( probably this is my last reply to ofono devs: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20200213191534.vz2mzxhkhr6i73r4@pali/
2020-02-13 20:16:55	Pali	I will send summary to pulseaudio ML with question if there is somebody interested in having HFP in pulseaudio / Linux
2020-02-13 20:21:44	wabbits	Pali some people are interested in HFP for reasons separate from HD codecs. But there are a lot of people interested in HD codecs and some are interested in the for HSP/HFP. Hope that makes sense.
2020-02-13 20:22:33	wabbits	Personally I only care about HFP if it gives my HD bi-directional low latency codecs suitable for voip.
2020-02-13 20:22:52	wabbits	if there is a way to have that without HFP its ok by me.
2020-02-13 20:24:51	Pali	HSP and HFP are only bluetooth profiles which support bidirectional audio
2020-02-13 20:25:10	Pali	(there is A2DP FastStream codec, but only supported by a few Creative Labs headsets)
2020-02-13 20:26:04	Pali	bidirectional wideband is only supported by HFP (+by A2DP FastStream)
2020-02-13 20:26:37	Pali	no other options
2020-02-13 20:27:10	Pali	this is why I started whole discussion about it 3 months ago and reason why I prepared prototype of my hsphfpd daemon
