2020-02-08 22:01:31	rektide	is there a filename people use for files intended to be sourced by zsh?
2020-02-08 22:01:58	rektide	i've been using .source but it was just totaly ad-hoc. i'm thinking maybe like .zsource or .zs to indicate that i intend this to be a zsh source file?

2020-03-31 18:30:29	snowe	any way to force a reload of completions _in the current shell_ while using --no-rcs? Use case: I'm trying to test a completion generator. I generate the completion script, place it somewhere, then use a PTY to test tab completing. Only issue is that the completions aren't reloaded until the PTY is restarted. I tried using rehash and hash -rf, neither worked.
