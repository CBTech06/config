Is there a way to modify that, to get dialogs opened on the workspace of the window that opens it?
2020-03-24 18:10:45	grove	I must admit that I haven't even checked with xprop yet, but now I got to remember it by seeing captainchris's question
2020-03-24 18:11:05	@squigz	You can probably match dialogs based on other criteria - but there's no command to move it to the workspace where it originally started, as far as I know. Startup notifications might work on those, but assigning all firefox windows to a workspace will override that
2020-03-24 18:12:36	captainchris	Yes i would like to have firefox on desktop 1 and other firefox with other profile on desktop 2
2020-03-24 18:12:40	captainchris	like grove 
2020-03-24 18:13:00	captainchris	but i can't modify class or title with firefox
2020-03-24 18:13:12	grove	Elodin: Make a script that runs xrandr and does one thing if there is more than one output and another if there's only one and bind to that
2020-03-24 18:13:32	@squigz	captainchris: If firefox doesn't have a way to specify class or instance name, there's not much you can do
2020-03-24 18:14:04	@squigz	You can launch profile 1, call `i3-msg` to move it, then do the same with another profile
2020-03-24 18:14:08	@squigz	but that isn't very reliable
2020-03-24 18:15:18	grove	I would settle for something different from class to match on in my assign line, that doesn't match dialogs (it's easy to start wondering if a site is broken if it opened a dialog that you can't see)
2020-03-24 18:15:24	nimaje	grove: probably you can make your criteria more specific to only match firefox's main windows and not the dialogs

2020-03-25 21:40:19	captainchris	I have a little problem  I have three windows (terminal) on the same desktop on left and two right I split container in vertically 
2020-03-25 21:41:22	captainchris	but when i want to switch windows to see more on screen with meta+shift+j 
2020-03-25 21:41:43	captainchris	the three container are vertical and don't respect organisation 
2020-03-25 21:42:50	nimaje	you could focus parent on the two container and move them

2020-03-31 22:37:54	QDX45	hey all, what's the status of using i3 with multiple graphics cards?
2020-03-31 22:37:54	botty	QDX45: Hello! Please be specific with your questions (read https://squigzy.pw/GettingHelpOnIRC) - and remember to be patient, as it may be some time before someone is around who can answer your question. In the meantime, make sure you've read the user guide, as well as the current /topic
2020-03-31 22:38:13	QDX45	I'm in the same situation as this guy on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/2uhrql/i3_across_multiple_xorg_screens/
2020-03-31 22:38:32	QDX45	I'm wondering if the solution is still to run multiple instances of i3
2020-03-31 22:39:59	QDX45	I know it's a specifically i3wm issue, because I installed ubuntu 18.04 and had all 4 screens working automatically, then installed i3 and rebooted, and only 2 screens are being used.

2020-03-31 22:44:26	search_social	QDX45: can't help, but would like to clarify ... the post seems to say that there are 3 separate concepts ... xorg "Xscreens", physical monitors, and video cards ...
2020-03-31 22:45:04	QDX45	gotcha.  Sorry, I did some more testing and I think it might turn out to work after all.
2020-03-31 22:45:41	search_social	by work, do you mean that a single window can be dragged between any of the monitors? because the post seems to say windows can't switch between monitors with differenent graphics cards

2020-03-31 22:47:28	QDX45	initially, 'work' meant making all of the displays turn on simultaneously.
2020-03-31 22:47:45	wwalker	Is there a way to move the window "marks" to the left side of the tab instead of the right?

2020-03-31 22:48:45	search_social	QDX45: well the solution in the post you gave seems to say you can have all 4 monitors turn on simultaneously with 2 i3s, but windows will not be able to switch between monitors of different graphics cards
2020-03-31 22:48:50	QDX45	I've gotten them working together now, so I think I'm good.  I moved over to ubuntu from void already, and seeing the same symptoms made me freak a bit and overreact.
2020-03-31 22:49:11	QDX45	I just dragged a floating window across all 4.
2020-03-31 22:49:18	search_social	QDX45: in i3 or ubuntu?
2020-03-31 22:49:23	QDX45	i3
2020-03-31 22:49:38	search_social	running 2 instances of i3 or 1 instance of i3?
2020-03-31 22:49:38	QDX45	Thanks very much for your help. I think I'm good. :)
2020-03-31 22:49:41	QDX45	just one
2020-03-31 22:49:44	search_social	okay, thanks
