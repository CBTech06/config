Use getopts (shell builtin) instead, or simply loop over the positional parameters.

2020-03-31 18:48:21	jwarren	Hey folks, I'm looking for some ideas. I have an automated process that runs ssh to a host, and then runs a command with some params. A problem I run into occasionally is that the command takes up a whole bunch of memory and then the OOM killer kills ssh because it's the parent process. Instead, I'd really like the OOM killer to kill the command
2020-03-31 18:48:21	jwarren	being run in the shell. I think I have a hacky solution, but I'm looking for some better ideas. My hacky solution involves spinning the command off to the background and then adjusting /proc/<pid>/oom_adj in hopes that the OOM killer will nix the child first and leave ssh alone. Can anyone think of a better approach?

2020-04-01 14:41:09	greatgatsby	Soliton, using trailing -rf saves a potential premature <enter> when typing the path and tab complete, when tired or not paying enough attention.  With -rf in front, any premature <enter> when tab completing through directories will blow away unintended files.  I read that some 20 years ago, and now it's just muscle memory, and has probably saved me more than once.

2020-04-01 20:41:33	greybot	Regular Expressions are used to *match* certain patterns in strings. They come in several flavors (BRE, ERE, PCRE, and more). Bash only supports EREs (using [[ string =~ pattern ]]). Sed uses BREs. See !ere, !bre, !pcre, http://mywiki.wooledge.org/RegularExpression
2020-04-01 20:41:54	blackandblue	if I want to search before specific regex I must use \ correct?

2020-04-02 23:07:38	Miyu-saki	I have a not-so-practical question. How do I copy `stdin` into a command? I'm trying to make a stupid one-liner, and the command does not have variables.
2020-04-02 23:07:50	Miyu-saki	Basically, I want stdin to be available in stdin and fd 3.

2020-04-02 23:08:37	greycat	what do you mean by "copy"?
2020-04-02 23:09:31	Miyu-saki	Like what `tee` does.
2020-04-02 23:09:56	greycat	I'm still not understanding the basic concept here.  You have a command A that writes something to stdout, and you want to do... what?
2020-04-02 23:10:23	Miyu-saki	I have a command A that writes to stdout. I want to pipe the command into B using stdin and fd 3.
2020-04-02 23:10:37	greycat	No sense makey.
2020-04-02 23:10:39	phy1729	I think   tee /dev/stderr 2>&3   may do what he wants
2020-04-02 23:10:51	greycat	What does B do?  Why do you believe it expects to receive input on fd 3?
2020-04-02 23:11:14	Miyu-saki	B is an interpreter. I'm writing a script that accepts from both stdin and fd 3.
2020-04-02 23:11:44	greycat	B < somefile 3< <(A)
2020-04-02 23:12:03	greycat	because *clearly* you want different streams

2020-04-04 21:34:54	osse	awk was a mess for me until I understood the basic building blocks of an awk script
2020-04-04 21:35:30	osse	which is:   condition { code }     for each record (which is a line by default) if condition is satisfied then run code.
2020-04-04 21:35:41	phy1729	condition { actions }    the first part of the man page is fairly short and helpful
2020-04-04 21:35:56	osse	ejr: $3 == "foo" { print $4 }   if column 3 is equal to "foo" then print column 4.
2020-04-04 21:36:10	osse	and that sums up all I know about awk :p

2020-04-05 19:31:51	earnestly	The stderr and stdout streams from a subshell don't change because you subshell them.  In the latter case you'll be redirecting both grep's and ping's stderr to /dev/null, but you can do that with { ...; } (command grouping) instead of a subshell which forks a new shell

2020-04-05 20:58:25	ejr	can i replace more than just one pattern with parameter substitution? (not referring to using //pattern/ instead of /pattern/, but to patern1, patern2 etc?
2020-04-05 20:58:26	twkm	moo.
2020-04-05 20:58:40	twkm	nope.

2020-04-05 20:59:04	ejr	ok, so how is this usually handled? sed?

2020-04-05 21:00:37	twkm	extglob can match pattern1..pattern2 then replace that with a single thing.  otherwise you'd be wanting multiple pe's, or sed.
2020-04-05 21:01:00	ejr	ok, thx

2020-04-05 21:14:41	ejr	how about counting how often a certain character appears in $string? also better suited for sed/awk?
2020-04-05 21:14:46	Fernando-Basso[m	I was reading an answer on the web that says one can use ‘\$’ , like to run a function my_fn for the PS1 variable, something like ‘PS1="\w \$(my_fn) \$"’ so  that the function is evaluated every time a new prompt is displayed?
2020-04-05 21:14:46	Fernando-Basso[m	Where exactly in the manual is that feature mentioned?

2020-04-05 21:17:32	Fernando-Basso[m	Hmm. Is it just because it being escaped is passed as code (instead of a literal) value to PS1?

2020-04-05 21:19:26	twkm	ejr: math.  compute the difference in length between the original and a copy with all the letter(s) of interest removed.
2020-04-05 21:19:53	twkm	Fernando-Basso[m: the section on quoting.
2020-04-05 21:20:03	ejr	twkm, yeah, thanks, i just thought of that too, something with ${var[^\/]} and then counting its length
2020-04-05 21:20:14	Fernando-Basso[m	twkm: Thanks.
