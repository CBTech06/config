2020-02-13 20:07:45	redtide	I can't for sure, I don't use jack_control, nor pulseaudio and I only have 1 soundcard...
2020-02-13 20:08:10	captainchris	and with jackd we can't switch between soundcard 
2020-02-13 20:08:26	captainchris	when i change playback same problem 
2020-02-13 20:08:27	redtide	(and not even QJackCtl if it is the one you mean)
2020-02-13 20:13:28	falktx	captainchris: you want to have 2 cards working at the same time?
2020-02-13 20:13:53	captainchris	no 
2020-02-13 20:14:03	captainchris	i want to select just if i would change 
2020-02-13 20:14:15	captainchris	first soudnd card is for my headphone 
2020-02-13 20:14:22	captainchris	and the second for the speakers
2020-02-13 20:14:41	captainchris	and sometimes i need change 
2020-02-13 20:15:19	falktx	why do you use jack_control ?
2020-02-13 20:15:30	falktx	why not something like qjackctl or cadence?
2020-02-13 20:15:42	falktx	if you are going to stop jack and start it again, there is no differece
2020-02-13 20:15:49	captainchris	I would like simple script 
2020-02-13 20:16:35	falktx	if you show the current script(s), maybe we can help
2020-02-13 20:18:06	captainchris	I made this in ptyhon

2020-02-13 20:23:54	captainchris	but it doesn't switch soundcard 
2020-02-13 20:28:34	captainchris	falktx: it is correct jack_control 
2020-02-13 20:29:02	captainchris	i run this script by ./jackStart --start MID or DSP24
2020-02-13 20:29:12	captainchris	or ./jackStart --stop 
2020-02-13 20:29:19	captainchris	to stop jackdbus 
2020-02-13 20:58:36	falktx	python?
2020-02-13 20:58:42	falktx	didnt you want something simple?

2020-02-13 21:02:57	falktx	it is starting to not be the best tool anymore perhaps
2020-02-13 21:03:14	falktx	captainchris: if you are stopping and starting jack, why not use jackd? why must you insist with jackdbus?
2020-02-13 21:03:22	captainchris	yes 
2020-02-13 21:03:28	captainchris	I tried everything
2020-02-13 21:03:33	falktx	if you have the latest jack2 release, it will sync with pulseaudio fine
2020-02-13 21:03:35	captainchris	jackd jack_control ... 
2020-02-13 21:03:43	captainchris	it was the same problem 
2020-02-13 21:03:54	falktx	then let it be with jackd
2020-02-13 21:04:01	falktx	if there is no sound, issue is somewhere else
2020-02-13 21:04:26	captainchris	with jackd I change -P hw:MID to hw:DSP24
2020-02-13 21:04:36	captainchris	and the output is always on the same soundcard 
2020-02-13 21:05:00	captainchris	I don't know why 
2020-02-13 21:06:23	falktx	you are supposed to change the -d hw:...
2020-02-13 21:06:28	falktx	-P is afterwards
2020-02-13 21:06:31	falktx	you dont need it
2020-02-13 21:06:39	captainchris	but -d is not alsa ?? 
2020-02-13 21:06:47	falktx	-d alsa -d hw:MID
2020-02-13 21:06:53	falktx	the 2nd -d is the alsa device
2020-02-13 21:06:59	falktx	first -d is driver
2020-02-13 21:07:20	captainchris	ok I thought -C is for capture(input) and -P playback(output)
2020-02-13 21:08:17	falktx	yes, but those are to separate in/outs
2020-02-13 21:08:32	falktx	without a 2nd -d, jack will use the default soundcard
2020-02-13 21:08:36	falktx	which is often the first
2020-02-13 21:08:43	falktx	(first soundcard in the system)
