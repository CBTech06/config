2020-04-04 12:45:37	captainchris	yes 
2020-04-04 12:46:01	captainchris	what program are good for that 
2020-04-04 12:46:04	nedbat	captainchris: you want to find an existing document format that can do that, like latex, or html, or markdown of some form.
2020-04-04 12:46:23	nedbat	or even, god forbid, google docs or ms word.
2020-04-04 12:47:19	captainchris	I'm under linux and I want small program
2020-04-04 12:47:40	nedbat	google docs works on linux
2020-04-04 12:48:07	captainchris	I don't want to use google producs
2020-04-04 12:48:07	toluschr	How can I completely disable the SELECT mode?

2020-04-04 12:49:14	toluschr	a plugin does it
2020-04-04 12:49:28	nedbat	what plugin? Why does it do that?
2020-04-04 12:50:21	toluschr	clangd. When I type a function name and hit enter on my keyboard, it selects the first argument and goes into the select mode.
2020-04-04 12:51:07	toluschr	and I have to press esc twice to get out of it
2020-04-04 12:51:27	osse	do you hapeen to have ultisnips or similar installed?

It's my chatty brain making bizarre connections.

2020-04-04 16:57:44	novum	what if the universe is a giant rubik's cube in a manner similar to how repeating the same algorithm on a rubik's cube will eventually result in a solved rubik's cube. Similarly, perhaps the universe goes through many cycles but eventually repeats. Or maybe there will just be a giant heat death. But if there is some cyclic pattern, then it seems very likely that there will inevitably be continuous
2020-04-04 16:57:45	novum	repeats. The longest one I found was LURD ... like a vortex (or inversely L'U'R'D') I never did get to the end. You do at least 800 rotations

2020-04-04 17:05:22	novum	on a vim note, K in termdebug is pretty cool and works pretty well. idk if isk was just set well, but it picked up variables very well. It's like doing  :exe "wincmd w|call term_sendkeys('p ".expand('<cword>')."\<cr>" basically. pretty nice. helped me, but I still didn't quite finish the last teensy tinesy bit. so hard =[

2020-04-04 17:07:44	novum	wish termdebug were developed a little more actively tbh. :Clear {num} didn't seem to work, for instance. If I had "breakpoint #2" on line 123, then :Clear 2 in theory would clear that bp. Also, the vim .c file would get pretty out of sync for no reason sometimes when I did  kill ; !make debug ; file theExecutable ; r  sometimes

2020-04-05 18:09:48	nedbat	UukGoblin: why would you use tabs for ascii art? You need exact placement: use spaces.
2020-04-05 18:10:04	UukGoblin	nedbat, because it's an ascii-art inside a tab-indented paragraph of text

2020-04-05 18:14:16	novum	UukGoblin, vim does handle this well :P but it does not cooperate with mixed tabs because that is pure madness. :retab
2020-04-05 18:15:06	novum	if one were to handle mixed tabs, how would you do it? For each level of indentation specify either an 's' or a 't' for space/tab? What about when softtabstop is not equal to tabstop? It is utter madnesss
2020-04-05 18:15:14	UukGoblin	novum, well, it handles it well only if you check what's in front of the lines and configure expandtab accordingly

2020-04-05 18:16:26	UukGoblin	novum, just that simple case: a working "autoindent", i.e. just copy over what the previous line had. Plus if someone presses 'tab', give him \t, and if someone presses space, give him ' ' in the output file
2020-04-05 18:16:29	novum	but that's not very general. What if you want an empty line (ie hit <cr> twice)? What if you want to turn it off or change just one tab or space or a bunch of them. How does :reindent know how to indent the first line? How does anything work

I saw that it may be colorscheme's conflicting with it, but removed any trace of them with no change in behaviour. What may have been causing this?

2020-04-19 18:51:39	nova	ubitux, that is the behaviour that is to be "expected". Vim vertically resizes the windows that don't have &winfixheight == 1 and horizontally resizes the windows that don't have &winfixwidth == 1 whenever a window is created or destroyed
2020-04-19 18:51:58	nova	You can fix the height of the top-left window by doing :set winfixheight

2020-04-19 18:53:13	nova	Indeed, it's not a very ... intelligent set up for handling window sizes, since when you have a 2 vertical splits and the left vertical split doesn't change at all on a window close, all nested splits in the the left split are resized, but that's just how it is

2020-04-19 18:57:58	nova	ubitux, I will say it is weird that adding a split doesn't mess up other splits not in the parent split while closing a split _does_. I would make sure it's not already an issue that is closed or still open, but you are free to submit any issue your heart desired

Since you're already working on 256 colours, I'm now wondering if there wouldn't be an easy way ti simply apply a "darken" filter across all colours, for instance. Alternatively, maybe just define a few primary colour components and define all other colours as functions of these?

2020-04-21 00:10:52	crose	As long as Escape, O, and A are written in the typeahead in a shorter time than 'ttimeoutlen', shouldn't Vim process the 3 keys as an unbreakable sequence of keycodes rather than 3 separate keys?

2020-04-24 19:19:45	hahuang65	essentially I'm trying to write a couple of functions to make my own "scratchpad" thing, so I writing a function that takes a filename and saves it to `/scratch` for now, and then I wanna also add a couple of functions to list what's in /scratch etc. Just trying to get my feet wet with Vimscript with something practical that I'll use.
2020-04-24 19:21:59	shmup	you'll wanna mostly just :e /path/to/scratches
2020-04-24 19:22:06	shmup	to list 'em

2020-04-24 19:23:12	hahuang65	shmup "learn how to do the things in general", such as what?
2020-04-24 19:23:44	nova	how about a buffer name instead of a file name? You can use writefile(getbufline(bufnr('partialBufNameAsString'), 1, '$')), '/tmp/scratch') for instance. just keep digging in help. ":help writefile()". use ctrl-] to jump to tags and ctrl-t back

2020-04-24 19:28:38	hahuang65	I just thought I'd tackle this because all the "scratchpad" plugins I see, either don't have a way to save your file in case you want it for later, or cannot set your ft in a streamlined fashion... I know I can always `set ft=` in the buffer, but I thought, why not just a function thats `:Scratch my_file.my_ext` and it'll do everything I want for me

2020-04-24 19:30:41	nova	hahuang65, you can also create a new buffer (:new and can also use :sil %d then setline(1, someList)) and set the 'buftype' to nofile (:set bt=nofile). Then it's not attached to a file and is, indeed, a "scratch pad" or some variation. But I think you should do it how you were thinking and experiment. just ramblings about alternatives.. :) good luck
2020-04-24 19:33:14	nova	(and with way above, instead of attaching the only scratch pad to a file, you basically store the buffer number inside s:bufnum or something. first set it to -1 and when it gets created the first time, then you can assign the positive number, and once it's created you can just re-open that buffer.)
2020-04-24 19:33:31	nova	((but the downside is it is not persistent.))
2020-04-24 19:33:33	hahuang65	nova yah thanks for the suggest, I'll tuck it away for reference. I think I'm gonna try to go thru Learn Vimscript the Hard Way at some point.
