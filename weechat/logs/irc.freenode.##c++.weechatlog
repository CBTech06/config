2020-03-22 13:19:09	RandomReader	I was actually just experimenting with that using your previous code, seems it can actually infer what it needs in this case, so no explicit type needed: https://wandbox.org/permlink/DRiBCSsLK3PICeJJ
2020-03-22 13:20:28	RandomReader	the syntax basically mirrors what you'd use for initializing an array, with the quirk that std::map stores pair<const key, value>

2020-03-22 16:23:55	TinoDidriksen	Chr0meiCe2, you have some serious terminology issues as well. Moving "a" one byte over means getting "a\0" or "\0a" ... if you mean add one to the value, that's +1. If you mean shift one bit, that's a whole other result.
2020-03-22 16:23:58	vdamewood	What does 'one byte over' mean?
2020-03-22 16:24:18	cbreak	vdamewood: prepend a byte? :)
2020-03-22 16:24:34	Alipha	If you add 1 to 'a', you will get 'b' if you're on a platform that uses ascii
2020-03-22 16:24:34	TinoDidriksen	It sounds like you just want to add int(1) to all bytes, which is trivial.

2020-03-22 16:37:01	ARoxdale	volatile also 'turns off' some compiler optimisations. Depends on the compiler, but some of them won't produce threadsafe code without adding volatiles and some additional memory fence instructions. I think if you use atomics, all that is handled automatically. I think.

It's a pretty good talk for comparing the old-style vs newer style methods for atomic operations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1T3IQ4N-3g
2020-03-22 16:41:51	ARoxdale	You can get thread safety with atomics only, but you have to to be extremely careful and you only have the lowest possible primitives to work with, and basically you will fail. Mutexes are the, horribly named, but most straightforward thread synchonisation primitive that "Just Works(TM)"

2020-03-22 16:44:55	InPhase	For performance and organization, avoid high level mutexing.  Mutexes are also a pretty low level component for threading, and should be restricted to implementing higher level abstractions like message passing that provide better guarantees for a problem-resistant threading architecture.
2020-03-22 16:46:11	InPhase	You don't get any scalability with threads if your threads spend all their time in contention, and you don't get reliability with threads if you have complicated logic where bugs can cause deadlocks.  So you want to abstract away those possibilities with a good interface.

2020-03-22 21:27:09	ville	is it legal to static_cast between the base classes of a type? struct cc : aa, bb {} in bb's ctor could i cast this to aa*?
2020-03-22 21:28:39	Oxyd	I wouldn't expect that to compile. Casting this to cc*, then to aa* should work, though.
