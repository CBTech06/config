2020-03-26 12:00:35	eyepeetee-	and so, there's 2 or 3 ways to look at this in my opinion. you can narrow the granularity down to configuration if you wish to, but, in my opinion, a tor hidden service, or i2p, or whathaveyou, is a hidden service regardless of configuration, and from the point of view of utility, like i said earlier, it's narrowed down to use case. if your goal is to hide yourself from other irc users, it
2020-03-26 12:00:36	eyepeetee-	doesn't matter the configuration

2020-03-26 14:31:00	indomitable	mquin, I'm assuming the SASL is set up with TLS?

2020-03-26 14:38:59	indomitable	gildarts, I think I just confused myself, it's been so long since I've set up or even looked at SASL, I guess it's just a replacement for messaging nickserv, lol.

2020-03-26 14:40:26	gildarts	Yeah, it just makes sure you are identified as soon as your connection completes. Can also allow using certificates for authentication rather than a password.
