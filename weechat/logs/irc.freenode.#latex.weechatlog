2020-04-08 22:58:39	captainchris	I have installed minted with pacman (Im on arch)
2020-04-08 22:59:19	glyj	you have to install python with pygments

2020-04-08 23:01:18	captainchris	yes python-pigment installed with minted 
2020-04-08 23:02:34	glyj	when compiling add --shell-escape to the lualatex command (if you are using lualatex engine )
2020-04-08 23:04:02	yushyin	reading the doc does help in such cases

2020-04-09 19:52:23	captainchris	ok
