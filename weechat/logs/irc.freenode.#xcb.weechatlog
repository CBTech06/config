2020-03-29 13:00:48	psychon	captainchris: xlib and xcb programming is similar and most parts, but there are also differences
2020-03-29 13:00:56	psychon	and I do not know about any books
2020-03-29 13:01:13	psychon	the xcb API mostly maps 1:1 to the X11 protocol
2020-03-29 13:01:19	psychon	Xlib does some "sugar ontop"
2020-03-29 13:01:39	psychon	https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html explains the X11 protocol
2020-03-29 13:02:27	captainchris	Ok acctually I read XCB documentation 
2020-03-29 13:02:36	captainchris	but it's really poor
2020-03-29 13:04:06	captainchris	but thank you for your information 
2020-03-29 13:05:32	psychon	most of XCB is directly the X11 protocol and that link ^ explains the protocol (well, not "explains", it's a reference)
2020-03-29 13:05:59	psychon	basically, all you need to know is that the reference talks about CreateWindow and the corresponding xcb function is called xcb_create_window
