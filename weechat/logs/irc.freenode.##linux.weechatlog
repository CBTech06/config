2020-03-31 20:28:23	sauvin	axirones, poor wording because it kinda depends on what the asker means by allowing Unger to see the device. Does that just mean being able to see the device node /dev/sdc itself, or does it mean allowing access to the drive's contents?

2020-03-31 20:31:15	sauvin	axirones, my experience in this is kinda limited, but I think you need to include "user" or "users" in that mount command somewhere, otherwise, Unger might see it but won't be able to write to it.

It doesn't seem to do it in real time though.  Also, I'm using Awesome WM.

2020-03-31 21:42:58	Foxfir3_	hexnewbie: Is it just me, or does that seem a bit dodgy?
2020-03-31 21:43:10	hexnewbie	Foxfir3_: I seem to recall S/MIME can be only signed. (I believe I switched the S/MIME option off in my mail client for signed emails, so my knowledge of it is indirect) Gmail's own client doesn't support signed and encrypted mails, from what I recall, so one would need to use their desktop client through IMAP.

2020-03-31 23:27:42	phogg	grill: so let me see if I understand. You have something like sda1 sda2 sdb1 sdb2 and you want to make sdc1 sdc2 sdc3 sdc4 out of them. Sound about right?

2020-03-31 23:28:51	phogg	grill: you still don't need dd (unless you want to be super cool), but you do need to be careful. Lay out the partitions on sdc to be the exact right sizes and you should just be able to cat each partition into its new counterpart. Don't mix them up.

2020-03-31 23:29:31	phogg	grill: what I would do, though, is make one big sdc1 and mount all 4 original partitions, then copy the files. It will probably be faster and it's a lot simpler.

2020-03-31 23:31:27	pingfloyd	I think your best bet is going to be setup the FSes on sdc and copy at the filesystem level
2020-03-31 23:31:29	phogg	pingfloyd: you could clone sda into sdc, then note the end point and dd sdb onto sdc starting at that point... but at that point making carefully sized partitions and copying one partition at a time makes sense
