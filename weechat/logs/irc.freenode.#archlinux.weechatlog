2020-03-20 21:47:19	beest	if you want to try doing this in real time in a directory that changes it's gonna be a slippery slope
2020-03-20 21:47:37	tatsumaru	i don't want to create tasks for this particular type of project, I just need to order the files, ideally if there's a file manager that I can move araound the files in and the order is rememberd that would be great

2020-03-24 16:44:46	th0rne	Probably a stupid question, but what does it mean to "disable hardware acceleration", like for a game? How does one do this?

2020-03-24 16:44:58	Almindor	let me try a different wm completely
2020-03-24 16:45:30	grawity	GNOME hasn't used ~/.gnome* for a very long time
2020-03-24 16:45:40	fogobogo	th0rne: typically means disabling that thing you have there for matrix calculations (also known as gpu) for rendering
2020-03-24 16:45:48	CubeTheThird	hardware acceleration refers to using native APIs on the hardware to best performance. The alternative is software acceleration, which means it's simulated

2020-03-24 16:47:24	th0rne	I wanted to see if doing this would help.
2020-03-24 16:47:26	grawity	on most modern games, disabling it entirely would literally give you 1 frame per minute
2020-03-24 16:47:37	th0rne	It's Civ3 from 2001.
2020-03-24 16:47:54	fogobogo	th0rne: probably even does. but if its anything complicated you probably get about 5 frames per second
2020-03-24 16:47:57	grawity	though for Mesa (OpenGL) that's done with LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
2020-03-24 16:48:07	fogobogo	th0rne: oh, that might just work with enough horsepower
2020-03-24 16:48:09	CubeTheThird	I'd recommend looking at the different proton flags you can set

2020-03-24 16:59:13	Foxboron	Pepe_: and, splitting build and install steps in packages for python is not a reproducability things. It's a uh...functional difference thing
2020-03-24 16:59:21	Foxboron	the package step should only package, the build step should build.
2020-03-24 16:59:27	Pepe_	yeah I get that
2020-03-24 16:59:49	Foxboron	the reprodcability issues comes from the bytecode generation afaik

2020-03-24 20:24:13	rcf	EmmetBrown: keep in mind that VCS PKGBUILDs do *not* actually stay in sync with upstream versions. You might see the PKGBUILD, and think it hasn't changed and that your current version is fine, but the stored pkgver is actually only updated at build time. The only *reliable* way to check versions is to run makepkg --nobuild.

2020-03-25 18:46:08	Z3ROGRAV1TYx	was just wondering if anyone could give me some guidance as to how i should go about creating a backup on my arch machine. I'm not too familiar with how LVM and LUKS plays a role in this, otherwise if it was just an Arch backup I'd be fine. I had a friend help me do a LVM on LUKS install (again, I'm new to using LVM), and I wanted to make a backup to restore from in case I want to refresh my Arch system, but don't
2020-03-25 18:46:08	Z3ROGRAV1TYx	want to remove my home dir. I frist wasn't sure if it was possible to have it do backups on the same drive, seeing it is a laptop all I have in it is an ssd. We did use the full capacity when setting up, so the backup would be within the LVM on LUKS install. So that seemed like it might cause issues and I wasn't sure. One other way I could do it is my friend has a synology nas, so if there was some way I can have it
2020-03-25 18:46:08	Z3ROGRAV1TYx	do auto backups to that, as long as it's encrypted than that'd work. Was just looking for guidance on what to avoid with my specific setup, and what to use for backing up.

2020-03-25 18:53:33	Z3ROGRAV1TYx	Namarrgon, I'm still not extremely familiar with backups on Linux tbh, I will look at them. But will I not run into issues backing up to the same drive within LVM-LUKS? Because if I need to rebuild Arch if something breaks or whatever, would It have issues just restoring from within the LVM partition?
2020-03-25 18:53:59	Namarrgon	unlock the container, mount the filesystem, make the backup

2020-03-25 19:40:24	SysGhost	Talking about hosts ... I read on some places that one now should use 127.0.0.1 as localhost, and 127.0.1.1 as machines given hostname. Not sure how etablished this practice is, but I started to do this on my machines. I evnen had a weird behaviour on one web server "fixed" with that practice.

2020-03-31 12:51:28	terzievk	I am having audio problem and I have been trying to fix it for the past few weeks. I can't get the audio to the laptop speakers and I can play only on headphones. Yesterday I tried resetting the pulseaudio as suggested in the wiki under pulseaudio/troubleshooting by removing some files like this: rm -rf /tmp/pulse* ~/.pulse* ~/.config/pulse and killing and starting pulseaudio. The audio was working fine. Then I rebooted to check if the
2020-03-31 12:51:28	terzievk	fix is permanent and it was. Until today. The laptop speakers are back to not working and it's getting quite frustrating. Do you have any suggestiong for me how to fix my speakers problem for good? Is there a way to reset all audio related without reinstall? Or maybe refer a wiki I have missed? Idk

2020-03-31 13:53:11	younic	hello there. I'm trying to configure sound with pulseaudio. I selected in Configuration Analog Stereo Duplex as I have a mic and headphones connected to a Xonar DGX card. The thing is that both, audio and mic work, but I cannot change the volume from the Output Devices tap. Has no effect. What am I doing wrong?

2020-03-31 15:05:11	ayhon	Hello, I installed Arch this morning (After installing a new SSD, this may be a root of the problem), following the guide (Yes, I installed the kernel, `linux` and `linux-firmware`, with `pacstrap`), but when I try to boot, it gives me an error. (http://ix.io/2g6G). Does anyone know where should I look into fixing it? Thanks in advance.
2020-03-31 15:05:43	ayhon	After giving the rror, it leaves me ina an emergency shell. The bootloader is rEFInd (`refind-efi`), and seems to work properly

2020-03-31 17:45:41	bin_bash	i copied libinput to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/80-libinput.conf as synaptics is 70-libinput.conf, an di was hoping on reboot it wouldnt work, but it does actually work on reboot, so im further stumped

When I set `Interval= repeat`  in that block,Icon shows up right after connection/disconnection. But, code is continuously running and wasting resources. So interval in seconds is not convenient anyways. My question is,can I trigger i3blocks from netctl when connected/disconnected. Can I add a
2020-03-31 20:32:20	ben888	hook in netctl to signal i3blocks. I hope a signal handler is already enabled in i3blocks. But, which signal should I use and where?
2020-03-31 20:32:20	ben888	_Thank you, all!_

2020-04-01 23:06:25	dustvoice	that I left my PC locked, with the monitor turned off, overnight. This now leads me to the following scenario: I turn on my monitor, and after approx. 15sec, it doesn't cycle through all input ports, but stays at DisplayPort (which is the connection I use), so it must detect something. But other than that, the display stays completely black/blank. I can switch ttys just fine, but everytime I
2020-04-01 23:06:27	dustvoice	switch to the Xorg tty, it stays blank. I have `xset s 600 10` in my xinit, if that helps you. Hope somebody knows of this problem and can help.

2020-04-01 23:14:11	dustvoice	So it just stays black when trying to use a lock screen. The system itself continues running, which explains why I can instantly switch to another tty

2020-04-04 16:57:06	cryzed	Hey, I was wondering if someone could help me out with a firewall question. I am using OpenVPN and ufw on my raspberrypi. The ufw setup only allows traffic through the `tun0` device and directly through some IPs (VPN DNS server). I now wanted to setup Syncthing on the raspberrypi and listen on some ports for incoming traffic (after forwarding the ports in the router). I assume when someone tries to establish a connecting on my WAN address to the
2020-04-04 16:57:07	cryzed	forwarded port, the packets would then arrive through my "eth0" network device -- and I basically oonly would need to open these ports for incoming traffic on my raspberrypi? I have yet to actually test this properly, I just wanted to know if I'm doing something obviously wrong

Also the others report my mic is noisy while it should actually sound good, it's a decent headset

(Qt preferred but doesn't matter) kdeconnect-sms's UI doesn't load conversations for me because there is a compatibility issue with samsung. I can see notifications but that's about it. Someone mentioned modem-manager-gui, but I'm not sure how to configure it

The screen stops refreshing after a certain point and gets stuck at whatever was displayed during the boot process. I know for a fact that is "visual" only cause I can login and reboot by typing on that stuck screen my username/password and issuing the "reboot" command. Anyone had a
