2020-03-31 11:47:19	captainchris	hi everybody who use dzen2 ?
2020-03-31 11:48:14	kmicu	abhixec: You should be able to use it now with https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html#g:3 (with minor adjustments) but dunno whether that’s a wise thing to do, geekosaur would know for sure fi counting windows is a safe thing in that Xorg context.
2020-03-31 11:49:20	kmicu	Hi captainchris: I can help with xmobar/taffybar only. Please state the question anyway and idle here for some time.
2020-03-31 11:49:57	captainchris	I need to create window popup to show keybings
