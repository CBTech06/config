2020-02-12 21:39:32	altendky	bonestormii_: there's a lot of back and forth there.  :]  i personally tend to avoid `if __name__ == '__main__':` almost entirely.  sure, there are cases, but importing a file and running it directly in the same process are bad.  and if it needs to be imported the most reliable way for that to work is to have a proper distribution package defined and to install it.  at that point you can use entry_points
2020-02-12 21:39:32	altendky	console_scripts to get a generated directly runnable file that calls a function from your code...  lots there but the gist is you usually don't need to have files that are both importable and `python myfile.py`'able
2020-02-12 21:40:29	altendky	bonestormii_: and definitely, otherfile.py shouldn't be inspecting myfile.py to figure out which way it was loaded. (aside from it not working, though i think i overlooked that in my first comment)

2020-02-12 21:57:07	charettes	Hey folks! I've been trying to import an import aliasing feature from Python 2 to 3 without success. The code makes it possible to alias a full module under a different namespace. e.g. you alias "django" under "bongo" with the following code https://gist.github.com/charettes/2354364254f09bb69bd09b02d568d4ac.

In the end I want to make sure "foo.submodule.obj is bar.submodule.obj" given "bar" is an alias for "foo".

2020-02-12 22:24:08	petemc	if you give it 5 cards it will tell you best hand, pretty basic
2020-02-12 22:24:18	papna	petemc: Then why does it take two arguments?
2020-02-12 22:24:20	petemc	oh, hmm, maybe it wants 7

Again, it doesn't allow remote execution/debugging, but it's nice if you have to dev in place on a remote host for some reason.

ABCs and abstract type hints.  What I’ve built feels ugly.  Pretty sure I know it’s ugly.

ABCs and abstract hints can’t be instantiated.  Is there any existing package mapping these to sensible concrete types?

I seem to remember running into this problem at some point, and it wasn't a csv, which is partly why I'm asking. I've already opened the csv module documentation, it seems really handy. thanks for the tip! I'll keep the newline thing in mind

2020-02-18 20:59:22	davor	I've got another question regarding which approach I should use. the csv lines are all "timestamp,value". I want to find the maximum at around the 10th second, +/- 100 ms or so. my first thought was I should use a list and iterate through it, testing the timestamp until I get to (10000*n)-100, note that index, and then look for the index of (10000*n)+100, note that, and print a maximum for that range. is there a more efficient way to do it? should I use
