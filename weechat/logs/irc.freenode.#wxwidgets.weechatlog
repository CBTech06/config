2020-03-23 22:20:18	captainchris	hi everybody
2020-03-23 22:21:20	captainchris	I'm new on wxwidgets I'm trying to code hello world from the wxwidget site 
2020-03-23 22:21:46	captainchris	I have GUI but I don't have menu and statusbar 
2020-03-23 22:21:53	captainchris	I paste my code 
2020-03-23 22:22:02	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/250WsSiY
2020-03-23 22:22:09	captainchris	Header file 
2020-03-23 22:22:19	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/iEyWTtmk
2020-03-23 22:22:24	captainchris	CPP file
2020-03-23 22:23:15	captainchris	do you have an idea ?? 
2020-03-23 22:25:46	DavidGH	captainchris: Caused by your OS or theme not liking *bars?
2020-03-23 22:26:44	DavidGH	What happens if you build wx yourself and build/run the 'minimal' sample?
2020-03-23 22:26:44	DavidGH	(Or, if your OS provides binaries of the samples, run it direct)
2020-03-23 22:28:19	captainchris	I have i3WM
2020-03-23 22:29:12	captainchris	but I must have to menufile 
2020-03-23 22:29:35	captainchris	I'm going to add text label on my wxframe
2020-03-23 22:30:39	specing	captainchris: why wx?
2020-03-23 22:30:49	DavidGH	I've never used i3WM. Do other similar programs have bars?
2020-03-23 22:31:14	captainchris	no I havge no titlebar 
2020-03-23 22:31:26	captainchris	but i have menubar in other application 
2020-03-23 22:31:39	DavidGH	OK
2020-03-23 22:35:40	captainchris	I'm trying to add a button to my frame 
2020-03-23 22:35:51	captainchris	and I look if it works

2020-03-23 23:02:24	captainchris	I have a problem with my button  undefined reference to `wxControl::SetFont(wxFont const&)'
2020-03-23 23:02:50	captainchris	If i disable constructor for my button I don't have error
2020-03-23 23:06:02	DavidGH	Have you updated the pastebins with the button code?
2020-03-23 23:06:16	captainchris	 nope 
2020-03-23 23:06:29	captainchris	I'm doing it 
2020-03-23 23:08:03	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/UDHFmJD5
2020-03-23 23:08:27	captainchris	I tried with wxT("Quit")
2020-03-23 23:08:31	captainchris	but same problem 
2020-03-23 23:13:01	DavidGH	You seem to be trying to derive your Button class from wxFrame
2020-03-23 23:13:31	DavidGH	why not from wxButton, if indeed you need a subclassed button at all?
2020-03-23 23:14:34	DavidGH	I strongly suggest that you download the wxWidgets tarball (probably the latest stable, 3.0.4) and at least _look_ at the samples/ dir
2020-03-23 23:15:00	DavidGH	Ideally build wx3.0.4 too. Then you can build and run any of the samples
2020-03-23 23:16:04	captainchris	I'm on arch and i have the wxgtk3 3.0.4-2
2020-03-23 23:18:06	DavidGH	Does it come with a samples package, or supply the samples in some other way?
2020-03-23 23:19:12	DavidGH	If not, it's still worth downloading the tarball. You can probably configure/build the samples against your distro's wx
2020-03-23 23:20:54	captainchris	I have sample ont github 
2020-03-23 23:21:41	captainchris	on zetcode class inherite from wxFrame 
2020-03-23 23:21:46	captainchris	http://zetcode.com/gui/wxwidgets/firstprograms/
2020-03-23 23:27:50	DavidGH	That sample calls its subclassed wxFrame 'Button' (which is silly, but...)
2020-03-23 23:28:31	DavidGH	but it's still a frame. It adds a wxButton later:
2020-03-23 23:28:37	DavidGH	wxButton *button = new wxButton(panel, wxID_EXIT, wxT("Quit"),   wxPoint(20, 20));
2020-03-23 23:29:39	DavidGH	All you need to do is to put that code line, and other relevant ones, into your original tutorial code
2020-03-23 23:30:04	captainchris	iin my wxFrame implementation ?? 
2020-03-23 23:30:18	 *	DavidGH still recommends the wx samples, which are _known_ to work
2020-03-23 23:30:36	DavidGH	Into the original code you pastebinned
2020-03-23 23:31:33	DavidGH	You need a frame class, derived from wxFrame. You add other things inside the frame constructor
2020-03-23 23:31:53	DavidGH	Those other things can include a wxButton, which you _don't_ subclass
2020-03-23 23:32:13	DavidGH	(unless you think you can design a better button than wx/gtk+)
2020-03-23 23:36:39	specing	captainchris: why are you using wxwidgets and not gtk directly?
2020-03-23 23:37:23	captainchris	why wxwidget is bad ??
2020-03-23 23:38:05	specing	I'm not implying that
2020-03-23 23:38:08	specing	I'm just asking
2020-03-23 23:38:37	captainchris	everybody says wxwidget is better
2020-03-23 23:40:21	specing	I've done some work maintaining a wxwidgets app. While the API is stable over a very long time, the problem is that some things are very hard to do. Such as theming (that modern users expect)
2020-03-23 23:41:27	captainchris	It's my first time with GUI I code with sfml and I would create a tilemap editor to improve my skill 
2020-03-23 23:41:47	captainchris	I choice wxwidget after a search on internet
2020-03-23 23:42:43	captainchris	my first choice was fltk  and after i decided to change for wxwidget 
2020-03-23 23:54:24	captainchris	Ok I ve found the solution 
2020-03-24 00:05:30	captainchris	on my makefile I build my project with wx-config-gtk3 on CXXFLAGS and I missed on LIBS
2020-03-24 00:05:47	captainchris	I used wx-config
2020-03-24 00:06:53	captainchris	and I have menubar and statusbar :(
2020-03-24 00:07:09	captainchris	I'm really stupid. thx for your help

2020-03-24 21:15:18	DavidGH	captainchris: I've no knowledge/experience of tilemap editors, but I doubt that wxGrid is what you want
2020-03-24 21:16:38	captainchris	Hi david yes. but i don't know if wxImage is the good solution 
2020-03-24 21:16:39	DavidGH	If you want images in a grid pattern, wxStaticBitmaps in a gridsizer sounds more likely
2020-03-24 21:21:16	captainchris	I think I will use a panel like image panel on the wxwiki 
2020-03-24 22:47:41	robert_	so hum, how do I use a FlexGridSizer? like how do I specify what row/column it's in?
2020-03-24 22:47:55	robert_	(sorry, for example, a Static text control)

2020-03-25 17:39:52	captainchris	I downloaded wxwidgets it is possible to build only samples ?? 
2020-03-25 18:05:23	DavidGH	captainchris: You need to run ./configure in the (extracted tarball) wx dir, using similar options to those of your system's wx install
2020-03-25 18:05:55	DavidGH	e.g. ./configure --with-gtk=3
2020-03-25 18:06:28	DavidGH	Then you should be able to cd into samples/ and run make -j to build them all,
2020-03-25 18:07:02	DavidGH	or e.g. cd samples/minimal && make   to build just that sample
2020-03-25 18:34:11	robert_	so can I justify text with wx?
2020-03-25 18:34:30	robert_	like how it appears in a book, nice and aligned
2020-03-25 18:35:49	robert_	or 'text-align: justify' (in css)
2020-03-25 18:38:49	captainchris	.david thanks
2020-03-25 18:40:59	DavidGH	robert_: Inside which control? e.g. are you using wxRichTextCtrl, or wxHtml* or...
2020-03-25 18:42:37	robert_	Any control, I I need a text label to be justified.
2020-03-25 18:43:54	robert_	I am asking if it's easy enough to accomplish using something not html
2020-03-25 18:44:41	DavidGH	As you'd have seen from its doc page, wxStaticText supports e.g. wxALIGN_LEFT, but it doesn't pretend to be a richtext control
2020-03-25 18:45:16	DavidGH	OTOH wxRichTextCtrl is a bit over-the-top for a simple label
2020-03-25 18:46:15	robert_	yeah
2020-03-25 18:47:08	DavidGH	As ever, run some relevant wx samples and see what suits you
2020-03-25 18:52:53	robert_	am, was just wondering if you had anything that came to mind. :D
2020-03-25 18:53:26	robert_	anyway https://i2.wp.com/justinakapaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tumblr_n03c59E4SK1trn8dmo4_500.jpg, kind of like this, lol
2020-03-25 19:17:19	DavidGH	robert_: Which of the jpg files were you thinking of?
2020-03-25 19:17:42	DavidGH	s/files/fields
2020-03-25 19:27:47	robert_	the text up top; it should justify if it wraps more than one line
2020-03-25 19:32:54	DavidGH	If you're using wx3.1 wxStaticText supports https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_control.html#afeb308dc3b54d8d735b33cb250395503
2020-03-25 19:33:08	DavidGH	Otherwise probably a read-only wxTextCtrl
2020-03-25 19:35:21	robert_	yeah I'm using 3.x
2020-03-25 19:39:13	robert_	I just want a label that applies justification like in a book, lol

2020-03-30 21:58:02	robert_	DavidGH: I snipped it down to just the class I'm having issues with. :D
2020-03-30 22:09:18	DavidGH	You are trying to catch mouseevents in a wxPanel. Does the panel have any child controls?
2020-03-30 22:09:39	DavidGH	If so, they won't tell the panel about their mouseevents
2020-03-30 22:10:41	DavidGH	Does OnMouseEvent() catch anything? You're only printing if dragging is found, not if it isn't
2020-03-30 22:12:37	DavidGH	A general comment: you are starting with something complicated and trying to get it to work.
2020-03-30 22:13:48	DavidGH	I strongly suggest that you keep it simple; make a minimal program that just tests mouse events,
2020-03-30 22:13:48	DavidGH	not something that resembles the final product
2020-03-30 22:14:10	DavidGH	Once it works, morph it into what you really want
2020-03-30 22:25:27	robert_	okay
2020-03-30 22:25:53	robert_	so it catches events
2020-03-30 22:25:54	robert_	however
2020-03-30 22:26:07	robert_	I get no events when trying to drag the button around
2020-03-30 22:31:22	DavidGH	Maybe the button is receiving the events. If so, the panel won't see them
2020-03-30 22:31:58	DavidGH	You would need to tell the button to pass them on to the panel e.g. by using Bind()
2020-03-30 22:37:08	robert_	I handle both, though
2020-03-30 22:38:08	robert_	instance is the button
2020-03-30 22:42:09	robert_	hmmm

2020-04-23 11:30:40	captainchris	can i Use wxscrolledwindows without class 
2020-04-23 11:31:07	captainchris	I have a GUI class who inherite wxFrame I want a scrolled window inside of it 
2020-04-23 11:33:25	DavidGH	captainchris: Do you mean "...without subclassing"?
2020-04-23 11:34:00	captainchris	yes like class GUI: public wxFrame 
2020-04-23 11:34:28	captainchris	{ wxScrolledWindow* scrolledwin ....
2020-04-23 11:34:43	DavidGH	See the samples that come with the wxWidgets source.
2020-04-23 11:35:46	DavidGH	There's the 'propgrid' sample that certainly does. There's also a 'scoll' sample that you should look at.
2020-04-23 11:36:16	DavidGH	*'scroll' sample
2020-04-23 11:36:56	captainchris	ok I see dnd sample and all use wxscrolledwindow inherited 
2020-04-23 11:37:42	DavidGH	^^
2020-04-23 11:38:13	captainchris	simple question 
2020-04-23 11:38:28	DavidGH	m_panel = new wxScrolledWindow(...)
2020-04-23 11:38:37	captainchris	do you think it's possible to code without sample just to use api??
2020-04-23 11:39:10	DavidGH	'code without sample' ??
2020-04-23 11:39:21	captainchris	yes 
2020-04-23 11:39:30	DavidGH	What does that mean?
2020-04-23 11:39:49	captainchris	programming application without sample just with api 
2020-04-23 11:40:16	DavidGH	I don't understand what you mean by 'sample'
2020-04-23 11:40:50	DavidGH	The wxWidgets samples, that are there to help you understand how to do things?
2020-04-23 11:41:17	captainchris	yes but do you think we programming without ??

2020-04-23 11:43:15	DavidGH	But! If that fails, if you read the docs but they don't answer your questions,
2020-04-23 11:43:25	DavidGH	then look at the samples
2020-04-23 11:44:06	DavidGH	Build the relevant samples too, and run them
2020-04-23 11:44:30	DavidGH	That way you can see what wxWidgets can do

2020-04-25 21:20:43	DavidGH	https://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/classwx_evt_handler.html#a03cc68ca201fb79c7e837919025be71a
2020-04-25 21:36:05	captainchris	the second
2020-04-25 21:37:42	DavidGH	Bind (const EventTag &eventType, void(Class::*method)(EventArg &), EventHandler *handler, int id=wxID_ANY, int lastId=wxID_ANY, wxObject *userData=NULL)
2020-04-25 21:37:42	DavidGH	So the first parameter, eventType, is wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED. That's fine
2020-04-25 21:40:55	captainchris	I see that on doc
2020-04-25 21:40:58	DavidGH	The second parameter, Class::*method, &GUI::OnQuit, is OK too. What about the third?
2020-04-25 21:40:58	captainchris	Bind(wxEVT_MENU, &MyFrame::OnExit, this, wxID_EXIT);
2020-04-25 21:41:10	captainchris	but why wxID_EXIT on the end ?? 
2020-04-25 21:42:08	DavidGH	You could use wxID_ANY (which is -1) for both event-ids if you wanted. But you actually only want to bind exit events
2020-04-25 21:42:12	captainchris	I do that  Bind(wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED,&GUI::OnQuit,this,wxID_EXIT);
2020-04-25 21:42:30	DavidGH	So you tell the Bind() to ignore anything that is not wxID_EXIT
2020-04-25 21:42:34	captainchris	wxID_EXIT is int id 
2020-04-25 21:42:39	DavidGH	Yes
2020-04-25 21:43:49	captainchris	I've lo'ts of difficult to read API 
2020-04-25 21:43:53	DavidGH	The 5th parameter is only used if you need to catch a _range_ of events. The 6th is almost never used so don't worry about it
2020-04-25 21:44:04	DavidGH	Yes, Bind() is difficult
2020-04-25 21:44:39	DavidGH	Examples are much easier, though. The wx samples were written before Bind() was invented
2020-04-25 21:44:54	DavidGH	but it is used in one of them
2020-04-25 21:46:41	captainchris	Yes it uses connect 
2020-04-25 21:46:52	captainchris	and i saw on the doc connect is deprecated 
2020-04-25 21:47:20	captainchris	I need to learning to read API

2020-04-25 22:03:41	captainchris	if I don't use setbackgroundcolor I see my pictur
2020-04-25 22:04:03	captainchris	and If i Setbackground it don't see my picture
2020-04-25 22:04:26	captainchris	I'm trying with sample and the rectangle appear on blue background 
2020-04-25 22:11:28	captainchris	I think it's beacause on drawing with wxPaintDC dc(this) and this is GUI and not my panel
