2020-04-17 17:38:15	captainchris	hi everybody 
2020-04-17 17:39:57	nihilazo	hello
2020-04-17 17:40:14	captainchris	I discovered vimwiki now.
2020-04-17 17:43:56	captainchris	I searched tool to make note.I try to use turtl joplin boostnode 
2020-04-17 17:44:34	captainchris	but I prefer tool cli 
2020-04-17 17:44:50	captainchris	and vimwiki are so perfect 
2020-04-17 17:45:01	captainchris	that's all ;)

2020-04-17 19:22:13	captainchris	what do you use vim gvim or nvim ?? 
2020-04-17 20:17:32	brennen	regular terminal vim.
2020-04-17 20:22:15	nihilazo	nvim
2020-04-17 20:22:51	nihilazo	mainly because it stores things in xdg rather than folders all over the place, honestly
2020-04-17 20:22:57	nihilazo	but async is also super useful
2020-04-17 20:35:35	captainchris	nihilazo: yes me too 
2020-04-17 20:35:42	captainchris	all config files at the same place 
2020-04-17 20:36:36	captainchris	and what linux distribution do you use ? 
2020-04-17 20:37:00	nihilazo	arch linux
2020-04-17 20:37:08	captainchris	yeah boy me too 
2020-04-17 20:37:09	captainchris	;)
2020-04-17 20:37:19	captainchris	I love arch 
2020-04-17 20:53:47	brennen	arch is neat, but my main use of it is to read arch wiki to figure out how to do things on other distros
2020-04-17 20:54:02	brennen	archwiki is flat out amazing.
2020-04-17 20:54:17	brennen	(long time debian head here.)
2020-04-17 21:12:22	nihilazo	arch wiki is the greatest resource, honestly. I've no idea how anybody would manage a linux system without it, even a non-arch system
2020-04-17 21:16:29	captainchris	yes before I used gentoo gentoo is very good distribution 
2020-04-17 21:16:46	captainchris	but compilation to update distribution is very long 
2020-04-17 21:20:43	captainchris	and do you use nerdtree ? 
2020-04-17 21:24:58	nihilazo	I don't use nerdtree, no
2020-04-17 21:25:17	nihilazo	I don't use much honestly, there are many improvements I could make to my vim setup but it's currently quite simple
2020-04-17 21:25:30	nihilazo	just switched out airline for lightline, I suppose
2020-04-17 21:27:35	brennen	captainchris: i'm a big fan of nerdtree, for whatever it's worth.
2020-04-17 21:28:14	brennen	i find these bindings pretty useful: https://code.p1k3.com/gitea/brennen/bpb-kit/src/branch/master/home/.vimrc#L547
2020-04-17 21:34:06	captainchris	ok 
2020-04-17 21:34:30	thecliguy	I wonder if there will be a vimwiki release soon... I think it was expected to happen some time around March/April.
2020-04-17 21:35:33	thecliguy	This is either the best time to do it (people are at home not doing so much) or the worst (they have job and health concerns to worry about).
2020-04-17 21:39:16	thecliguy	I guess it depends which camp the project maintainers are in.
2020-04-17 22:07:17	brennen	a more regular release cadence does seem like a good idea.
2020-04-17 22:11:08	captainchris	and what desktop/wm do you use ?? 
2020-04-17 22:11:58	nihilazo	me? i3-gaps, because I fell for the meme and I've yet to find anything I like more
2020-04-17 22:13:12	brennen	xmonad
2020-04-17 22:14:59	captainchris	waowww I use i3gaos too 
2020-04-17 22:15:12	captainchris	xmonad is not hard with haskell code ?? 
2020-04-17 22:19:01	brennen	the configuration can be a little tricky
2020-04-17 22:19:33	nihilazo	what are the major advantages of xmonad vs i3?
2020-04-17 22:22:01	captainchris	I use lot of time awesome and lua gives me button 
2020-04-17 22:22:08	thecliguy	Well, I've asked the question about a release: https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/issues/638
2020-04-17 22:22:10	captainchris	I switch to I3 
2020-04-17 22:24:03	thecliguy	I hope people don't think it heartless to ask the question what with the state of the world right now. I tried to be empathetic to the current situation.
2020-04-17 22:24:17	brennen	captainchris: honestly i don't know how to answer that.  i used i3 a bit and it didn't really seem like what i wanted, but i was already very used to xmonad at that point.
2020-04-17 22:37:30	captainchris	Yes of course everybody has different taste 
2020-04-17 22:46:05	ubitux	and some people obviously have bad taste :s
2020-04-17 22:47:01	brennen	the things i like about xmonad are speed/responsiveness, the layout model, and the ability to switch workspaces independently on multiple monitors.
2020-04-17 22:48:41	captainchris	nihilazo: and I suppose  your terminal is termite ??? ahahah ;)
2020-04-17 22:48:54	captainchris	brennen: what terminal emulator do you use ?? 
2020-04-17 22:51:46	nihilazo	my terminal is termite but I've been meaning to check out other things
2020-04-17 22:52:35	nihilazo	I never use termite's specific features and maybe I could use something smaller and faster
2020-04-17 22:57:17	brennen	right now i use konsole for most things and gnome-terminal for the window where i usually have my vimwiki open.  until pretty recently i used plain old uxterm for most things.
2020-04-17 22:57:34	brennen	i've also experimented with alacritty recently.  it seems pretty nice.
2020-04-17 22:59:42	brennen	if i remember right i'm just using gnome-terminal for vimwiki notes because it was easier to set up with the xmonad namedscratchpad extension.
2020-04-17 23:00:12	nihilazo	alacritty would probably be my terminal of choice but I've no idea if it works across things like raspberry pis and I know for sure it doesn't work on older laptops
2020-04-17 23:00:20	nihilazo	which are what I still use a lot of the time
2020-04-17 23:03:32	brennen	yeah, i imagine the gpu acceleration does rule out some older hardware.
2020-04-17 23:04:34	brennen	honestly, i'd probably still just be running xterm but it's easier to tweak fonts and change them on the fly with some of the newer options.
2020-04-17 23:07:13	ubitux	alacritty is awesome, but there are still a few annoying limitations
2020-04-17 23:08:10	ubitux	most important ones being the scrollback search (#1017) and opening links with the keyboard (#1725)
2020-04-17 23:08:16	ubitux	i miss those from my urxvt time
2020-04-17 23:08:51	ubitux	there are a few other details, but aside from that, definitely my most recent workflow modernization
2020-04-17 23:10:26	ubitux	they're working on a vi-mode though, which is likely going to address these issues soon enough
2020-04-17 23:24:24	captainchris	It's very interresting to talk with you 
2020-04-17 23:59:08	captainchris	bye guy

2020-04-18 21:52:02	captainchris	how are you today ?? 
2020-04-18 21:53:16	nihilazo	tired, been trying to get calendar+taskwarrior sync servers going with no luck
2020-04-18 21:54:42	nihilazo	taskwiki seems to like removing links from task names which is annoying because I often like to make a link from a todo entry with the information for that thing
2020-04-18 21:55:15	captainchris	yes I understand 
2020-04-18 21:55:38	captainchris	sometime i spent lot of times to do something and sometimes tha't doesn't work

2020-04-19 11:08:16	captainchris	I would like add c++ code in my wiki 
2020-04-19 11:08:38	captainchris	I tried with {{{cpp snippet of code }}} but I don't have syntax color for cpp 
2020-04-19 11:10:23	ubitux	try to :e the file
2020-04-19 11:10:38	ubitux	(i'm also assuming you're doing it multi line)
2020-04-19 11:13:20	ubitux	you can see that mentionned in the Note in :h vimwiki-option-automatic_nested_syntaxes
2020-04-19 11:19:27	captainchris	ubitux: Ok I saw  the file on the Doc folder entries.png 
2020-04-19 11:19:34	captainchris	{{{go ... 
2020-04-19 11:22:12	captainchris	nope that doesn't work 
2020-04-19 11:22:36	captainchris	I made all like the help {{{cpp }}} and re-edit with :e 
2020-04-19 11:23:03	captainchris	I have also header no colorscheme

2020-04-19 13:01:42	captainchris	do you use vim or nvim ?? 
2020-04-19 13:03:10	ubitux	it works with both, i just tested

2020-04-19 13:07:01	captainchris	and do you install plugin vim vimplug or manually ??

2020-04-19 13:07:29	ubitux	i did the manual thing for this particular test
2020-04-19 13:07:40	ubitux	but it shouldn't make a difference
2020-04-19 13:08:23	captainchris	yes =Header= doesn't work 
2020-04-19 13:08:30	captainchris	it's #Header# 
2020-04-19 13:08:42	ubitux	isn't it because you're using markdown?
2020-04-19 13:08:55	ubitux	if so, you need to use ```cpp ...
2020-04-19 13:09:21	captainchris	yes 
2020-04-19 13:09:31	captainchris	it's work like that
2020-04-19 13:09:54	captainchris	Ok I need to you use .wiki ?? 
2020-04-19 13:10:05	captainchris	instead .md 
2020-04-19 13:10:14	ubitux	well, depend what you want
2020-04-19 13:10:32	ubitux	.md → markdown → ``` ... ```
