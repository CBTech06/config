2020-03-17 19:46:45	ZubairAbidGitter	So it would help to take a look at how plugins are written in lua, if I'm getting this right?
2020-03-17 19:49:50	jaawerth[m]	I'm guessing from the quote you already saw https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/GSoC-2020-Ideas#support-for-Lua-plugins-and-configuration right? beyond what's there, since it's a gsoc thing, and bfredl and norcalli are listed as mentors for it, they likely have some thoughts on this and maybe even good places to start
2020-03-17 19:50:33	jaawerth[m]	(one of 'em will probably chime in when they see this ;-) )
2020-03-17 19:51:36	jaawerth[m]	but yeah looking at existing lua plugins would be a good start. they aren't always easy to find but one I know of offhand is nvimux. oh and iron.nvim
2020-03-17 19:52:48	BjrnLinseGitter[	yea that project is a bit open ended.
2020-03-17 19:52:48	jaawerth[m]	I've got one, but it would probably be confusing as a reference since it's entirely there to bridge lua to fennel, and I've got a (paused) rewrite that I'll probably resume amid the pandemic lockin to rewrite it entirely in precompiled fennel

2020-03-17 21:59:55	jaawerth[m]	lua docs are a good resource for sure. and you can do quick lookkups of the docs using devdocs.io or zeal/dash docsets. as a primer/crash course/reference I'm also a big fan of https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua

2020-04-20 23:37:51	LeoNerd	Huh... I thought that nvim was sometimes getting confused about fast-typed <Esc>: being interpreted as <Alt-:> even through all my CSIu'ed termkey hackery.
2020-04-20 23:38:08	LeoNerd	After much instrumentation it turns out: no. Just sometimes I manage to type fast enough that my keyboard doesn't actually register the <Esc> key at all
2020-04-20 23:38:12	LeoNerd	so I type a plain : in insert mode

2020-04-29 23:25:45	JustinMKeyesGitt	@BK1603 did you already read the notes in `src/nvim/memfile_defs.h`
2020-04-29 23:26:29	JustinMKeyesGitt	and the headers in `memfile.c` + `memline.c`
2020-04-29 23:26:48	JustinMKeyesGitt	i will attempt a tl;dr:

2020-04-29 23:28:16	JustinMKeyesGitt	memfile is the "swap file", i.e. the memlines are written to a file on the filesystem. This was Vim's own "virtual memory system". Partly for memory-constrained systems, partly for recovering after system crash, and partly a way to support loading files that do not fit into memory

2020-04-29 23:33:19	JustinMKeyesGitt	tl;dr: it's basically a shallow tree , almost a list, of lines, for the purpose of avoiding some degenerate performance issues *within a buffer*. But *within a line* performance sucks.

2020-04-29 23:36:59	ShreyanshChouhan	I did read these headers, there are still a few things that I do not understand: what is the line number of a cached line in `memline`? Also is `ml_stack` populated when we search for a line? So that it stores the path of the most recently accessed line?

2020-04-29 23:38:06	ShreyanshChouhan	comment for `linenr_T ml_line_lnum` says that it is the line number of a cached line
2020-04-29 23:39:25	ShreyanshChouhan	Which line is cached? And are these lines having the same meaning as a line in the buffer (total lines being the last number displayed by `:set number`)? Or are these lines different?
