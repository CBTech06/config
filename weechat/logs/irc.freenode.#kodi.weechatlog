2020-02-08 17:31:53	pragmaticenigma	captainchris, what do you mean by mainscreen? ... There is no main or home screen that I'm aware of
2020-02-08 17:32:20	captainchris	pragmaticenigma: home screen I would like icon with youtube netflix ... on the home screen 
2020-02-08 17:35:13	pragmaticenigma	captainchris, there is no "home screen" to add icons to... in the default skin there are categories running down the left side of the screen. You can press the letter "C" on an add on, and add it to favourites, which will then add a shortcut in the Favourites category.
2020-02-08 17:36:38	captainchris	Ok it is not possible to get icon on the home screen
2020-02-08 17:41:46	pauljw	captainchris, in estuary, if you scroll all the way to the bottom of the main tv shows screen there are icons for each studio that you have shows from.

2020-02-08 18:06:42	pauljw	that's a scraper issue, not kodi, but you should be able to go to the movie and refresh it.  it might list several options, pick the correct movie and date and it should repopulate with the correct graphics if they're available.  sometimes things just aren't online.

2020-02-08 18:32:45	zekuj	hey there. getting back to Kodi. I badly want to get logos for TV series to work. Logos are so much better than posters/banners. I found a wiki with skin capabilities. Supposedly Aura should support logos
2020-02-08 18:33:02	zekuj	does anyone happen to have logos going? what next?
2020-02-08 18:33:07	zekuj	can this even work with TMDB?
2020-02-08 18:34:08	zekuj	i distinctly remember a setting like "prefer logos over banners" or so, but that was like 7 years ago?
2020-02-08 18:39:44	pragmaticenigma	can you find an example of what you mean by "logos" ?
2020-02-08 18:40:14	daftykins	yeah is this original airing station logos, or thumbnails?

2020-02-08 18:43:53	zekuj	https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/series/75978/icons/62047362.jpg pragmaticenigma
2020-02-08 18:44:11	zekuj	if you have a TV library set up with logos, it looks insanely clean
2020-02-08 18:44:35	zekuj	a lot of xbmc skin shad pretty great "clear arts" as well, where logos or CD covers were transparently overlayed in the pause screens
2020-02-08 18:45:01	zekuj	it gives the entire UX a feeling of branding, it completely baffles me why logos are not the default literally everywhere when it comes to TV
2020-02-08 18:45:16	pragmaticenigma	zekuj, the artwork is selected by the scraper, so I think it all depends on what service and scraper you use on your media
2020-02-08 18:45:30	zekuj	yeah i'll swap it to tvdb
2020-02-08 18:45:35	zekuj	that used to be the default i think
2020-02-08 18:46:27	zekuj	i mean worst case i'll add them manually it's not even so hard. main part is getting the skin to show them tho :P
2020-02-08 18:46:38	zekuj	hope aura can actually do it like the wiki suggests
2020-02-08 18:46:51	pragmaticenigma	the skin just uses what's stored with the meta deata
2020-02-08 18:46:54	pragmaticenigma	*data
2020-02-08 18:47:23	daftykins	zekuj: set it up on a clean install with one or two series to test perhaps
2020-02-08 18:47:30	zekuj	bat "banners", "posters" and "logos" (at least in the past) are different metadata concepts and can co-exist
2020-02-08 18:47:41	zekuj	you'd name them logo.png, poster.png and banner.png or so if you did it manually
2020-02-08 18:48:02	zekuj	ah i'm at the process of swapping back from the plex anyway
2020-02-08 18:48:12	zekuj	i should have never let myself get talked into doing the plex thing
2020-02-08 18:48:34	zekuj	probably going to spin up emby and jellyfin later too
2020-02-08 18:48:48	daftykins	no logos here with manually exported artwork... i wonder if it got dumped
2020-02-08 18:50:43	pragmaticenigma	zekuj, I guess if I had any advice... i would just spend time getting reaquianted with Kodi as it exists today before trying to make it feel like it might of in yester-year
2020-02-08 18:52:42	zekuj	yeah i kind of did, it's all set up and i am at the point where i am testing out different skins
2020-02-08 18:52:43	daftykins	+1 to that
2020-02-08 18:52:53	zekuj	the one thing that seems actually new are how widgets/addons integrate into skins now

2020-02-08 18:56:16	pragmaticenigma	I have mine setup with TheTVDB for tv series, and what I see is probably more like box art, I haven't seen TVDB supply plain logos in quite some time
2020-02-08 18:56:34	zekuj	what skin do you use?
2020-02-08 18:56:40	pragmaticenigma	everything I have is in the default
2020-02-08 18:56:50	zekuj	that's Estuary i believe?
2020-02-08 18:56:55	zekuj	yeah that skin has next to no capabilities
2020-02-08 18:56:58	zekuj	by design
2020-02-08 18:57:38	pragmaticenigma	I typically use what ever the program comes with. I find other skins hide features because the creator didn't use it, so they assume I won't want it either?

2020-02-08 19:00:21	zekuj	That's the nice thing about having a default skin that is so limited, though
2020-02-08 19:01:05	zekuj	that being said, I share your philosophy in general
2020-02-08 19:01:36	daftykins	Estuary does all i need :)
2020-02-08 19:01:46	zekuj	But coming back from Plex... my god I missed the power of Kodi :) it was nice being lazy for a few years. But now we have smart home stuff, home assistand and a harmony etc. stuff already feels so much nicer now
2020-02-08 19:02:03	zekuj	so i want the bells, whistles and customization if that makes sense
2020-02-08 19:02:21	daftykins	i'm surprised that Plex hasn't taken to any of those, what kind of issues were you having?
2020-02-08 19:03:01	zekuj	With Plex? They keep abandoning their platforms. And they try to monetize it in less and less tasteful ways but I am very stubborn
2020-02-08 19:03:14	daftykins	ah i see
2020-02-08 19:03:14	zekuj	That being said, it is very polished by now
2020-02-08 19:03:54	zekuj	but at this point my elderly parents are just too overwhelmed with the distractions and UI changes that are out of our control

2020-02-08 20:02:04	K-tel	Right....so I have tons of TV shows.  Added the share to Kodi.  Indexed it.  Multiple times.  I click on the menu item for TV shows, nothing shows up, I have to browse folders.  Will this be fixed in a future update?

2020-02-08 20:09:10	K-tel	I mean, I find it rather ridiculous that the basic function of showing me my content isn't functional.
2020-02-08 20:09:55	TeamKodi	[unknown] Do you really think that a mediacenter with 10 million users, which primary feature is scraping local content like TV shows - has this feature broken?
2020-02-08 20:10:04	TeamKodi	[unknown] Did you never consider that you just did something wrong?
2020-02-08 20:10:23	pragmaticenigma	K-tel,  you also haven't given any information about your setup, no details what so ever... none of us are telepathic
2020-02-08 20:10:32	TeamKodi	[unknown] Start with your debuglog
2020-02-08 20:12:00	K-tel	I have windows shares with tons of content.  The music stuff is easy enough, all tagged, added the share, it indexed.....not exactly the best navigation, and artwork is spotty at best, but whatever.  But I added the share that movies and TV shows are on, movies mostly show up, although some come up incorrect, it shows blues brothers and blues brothers 2000, which is an insult to a classic movie, but nothing shows up under TV shows.
2020-02-08 20:12:08	K-tel	And I have tons of TV shows in my folders.
2020-02-08 20:12:20	K-tel	I can get to them if I browse by folder, so clearly Kodi has access to the files.
2020-02-08 20:12:29	-->	utack (~utack@x5f75435a.dyn.telefonica.de) has joined #kodi
2020-02-08 20:12:29	K-tel	But, it says I have no TV shows if I select that from the menu.
2020-02-08 20:12:56	K-tel	I just find navigation in general to be lacking, and it's among the most non-intuitive programs I've ever used.
2020-02-08 20:12:57	}8]	K-tel does your tv shows use a naming convention kodi knows?
2020-02-08 20:13:26	K-tel	Not sure, there's been no requirements indicated by kodi as I set this up.
2020-02-08 20:13:30	}8]	for example: tvshow/season.01/tvshow.s01e01.mkv
2020-02-08 20:13:46	TeamKodi	[unknown] did you scrape it as tvshows? Or did you just scrape it as movies? Rather sounds like you chose a mixed folder and selected movies ...
2020-02-08 20:14:14	K-tel	Well, I added the folder in movies, and when I went to add it in TV shows, it was already there.
2020-02-08 20:14:23	K-tel	it seems kodi is acting like they're the same thing.
2020-02-08 20:14:33	K-tel	So I figured, ok, whatever, you know where the files are....show me my stuff
2020-02-08 20:14:38	K-tel	But nope
2020-02-08 20:14:44	TeamKodi	[unknown] you figured wrong
2020-02-08 20:14:54	K-tel	Well, there's nothing pointing me in the right direction
2020-02-08 20:14:56	K-tel	the folder is added
2020-02-08 20:14:58	K-tel	I index it
2020-02-08 20:14:59	K-tel	nothing shows up
2020-02-08 20:15:02	TeamKodi	[unknown] if you select content type "movie" then it obviously won't show up as tvshows
2020-02-08 20:15:05	daftykins	only a whole wiki on how to name content
2020-02-08 20:15:18	K-tel	But I also added it under tv shows
2020-02-08 20:15:21	K-tel	or it's listed under tv shows
2020-02-08 20:15:29	K-tel	and I index it when I'm trying to find tv shows
2020-02-08 20:15:29	TeamKodi	[unknown] adding a share is first thing, selecting content is second
2020-02-08 20:15:47	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, First... you will need to separate your movies and tv shows into different folders on your server. And then add the specific folders for movies and the specific folder for tvshows separately
2020-02-08 20:15:47	TeamKodi	[unknown] if scraper is set to movie, you won't find any tv show
2020-02-08 20:16:06	TeamKodi	[unknown] the wiki is again clear about that
2020-02-08 20:16:22	K-tel	Then how come what I add under movies shows up under TV shows?
2020-02-08 20:16:30	K-tel	Do you have any idea how confusing and non-intuitive that is?
2020-02-08 20:16:39	K-tel	It's like you tried to program the biggest piece of garbage you could.
2020-02-08 20:17:06	K-tel	I do have movies and TV shows in separate folders
2020-02-08 20:17:07	daftykins	you're not even using Kodi's own terms, which shows you've not put any effort into understanding how the library management works
2020-02-08 20:17:08	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, go on and keep insulting the people that are trying to help you... see how far you get
2020-02-08 20:17:17	daftykins	you can't work it and you're blaming the devs, you are a classic idiot user

2020-02-08 20:18:39	K-tel	Alright, so I need to remove my video share, and then add it back in twice, on the TV folder, and the movie folder, to start with.
2020-02-08 20:18:49	TeamKodi	[unknown] no
2020-02-08 20:18:53	pragmaticenigma	No K-tel you didn't follow what I said
2020-02-08 20:19:07	K-tel	I mean....add it in, going down a level, I have movie and tv folders in my video share.
2020-02-08 20:19:16	K-tel	so I need to add the individual folders instead of the parent
2020-02-08 20:19:20	pragmaticenigma	correct
2020-02-08 20:19:33	fritsch	and the movie one to movies
2020-02-08 20:19:38	fritsch	and the tvshows to tvshows
2020-02-08 20:19:50	fritsch	after the share is added it will ask for "which content"
2020-02-08 20:19:50	daftykins	but only once the content naming structure matches what is suitable for Kodi's scrapers
2020-02-08 20:19:51	K-tel	Um....any reason the software can't support having the parent folder added and sorting out the sources from there, for simplicity of configuration?  Just an honest question.
2020-02-08 20:19:51	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, there is a way to do it with the parent... but for the moment it is easier if they're kept separate
2020-02-08 20:19:55	fritsch	then choose appropriately
2020-02-08 20:20:13	fritsch	K-tel: it can - but you told "the software". This is all movies
2020-02-08 20:20:34	K-tel	how do I tell the software it's movies and tv shows?
2020-02-08 20:20:47	fritsch	again, this was told to you as well
2020-02-08 20:21:22	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, You add the parents share... then when in file browse mode you go to the movies folder, press C, then "set content"
2020-02-08 20:21:35	pragmaticenigma	then setup for movies... then do the same process for tv shows
2020-02-08 20:21:37	K-tel	press C....uh....I'm doing this on a fire stick.

2020-02-08 20:22:31	K-tel	What makes you think I'm purposefully holding back information.
2020-02-08 20:22:42	fritsch	you were asked to post your debuglog, did not do that
2020-02-08 20:22:47	K-tel	I've given what I thought were relevent details, I've answered any questions asked, I'm not holding anything back.
2020-02-08 20:23:05	K-tel	I'm not sure how to get a debuglog off of a firestick, or where to send it.
2020-02-08 20:23:10	fritsch	you did not say anything about your system, even asked by two of them
2020-02-08 20:23:13	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, RELEVENT WOULD BE WHAT PLATFORM YOU ARE RUNNING KODI ON!!!

2020-02-08 20:24:03	fritsch	while you clearly fail to use it and additionally read documentation
2020-02-08 20:24:10	K-tel	I've read the documentation, I've gotten as far as installing kodi on a firestick, adding shares, watching and listening to content browsing folders, getting music indexed......I've read the documentation, I've not understood all of it.

2020-02-08 20:24:29	K-tel	I come in with some questions, clearly confused, and you do the typical user blaming game that most devs do
2020-02-08 20:24:46	fritsch	so - what is ther result of the last 15 minutes?
2020-02-08 20:24:49	daftykins	first off not everyone is a dev... and you started with complaining when you didn't know how to use it
2020-02-08 20:24:56	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, no... that's called confirmation bias... you came here expecting that to happen... and at the first glimmer of it, you assume that was happening
2020-02-08 20:25:02	fritsch	A user not reading, not giving information, demanding ...
2020-02-08 20:25:07	fritsch	everything was fully confirmed
2020-02-08 20:25:11	K-tel	result is I can try to set content type of my parent folder and see how far that gets me.
2020-02-08 20:25:25	K-tel	content type of folders under parent folder I mean
2020-02-08 20:25:27	fritsch	and again, this proves you did not read what others wrote
2020-02-08 20:25:34	K-tel	or, remove, and readd individual folders
2020-02-08 20:25:41	fritsch	that is correct
2020-02-08 20:25:49	fritsch	good - then try and see if it works
2020-02-08 20:26:05	fritsch	details with pictures here:  https://kodi.wiki/view/Adding_video_sources
2020-02-08 20:27:07	fritsch	so first answer given: we cannot fix it in next version as you used it wrong still stands ... (just to emphasize on the confirmation bias)
2020-02-08 20:27:32	daftykins	and once again, the content should be named in an acceptable form and in a sensible folder hierarchy too :)
2020-02-08 20:27:53	fritsch	which is also emphasized and describe in the user manual :-)
2020-02-08 20:32:40	daftykins	fritsch: hope you're well btw, feels like it's been a while
2020-02-08 20:33:07	K-tel	Alright, changing the content type on the TV folder under my Videos folder has got me on the right path.
2020-02-08 20:33:35	fritsch	perfect
2020-02-08 20:33:55	fritsch	if you have a firetv4k and wonder about some videos being out of sync - make sure to check the android forum
2020-02-08 20:33:57	K-tel	Any reason it relies on specific folder/naming schemes rather than tags for TV shows?

2020-02-08 20:34:30	fritsch	it will only use the movie scraper

2020-02-08 20:34:34	fritsch	no AI in there yet
2020-02-08 20:35:30	K-tel	No, I mean, once it's set to TV shows, it has to be named in a specific way.  Why not scrape the tags instead?  Relying on file tags instead of naming schemes seems to have a better chance of success in identifying content from a programming point of view.
2020-02-08 20:35:56	K-tel	Like it does for music.
2020-02-08 20:37:11	K-tel	Oh, that reminds me....I added a specific music video folder to music videos, but music videos still comes up empty.
2020-02-08 20:37:18	K-tel	What's the requirements there?
2020-02-08 20:37:31	<--	SvenskTiger (~p0lisen@37.120.223.75) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2020-02-08 20:38:35	fritsch	two things: a) Music Video is set as content
2020-02-08 20:38:50	fritsch	b) proper naming as daftykins pointed out
2020-02-08 20:39:02	fritsch	you can check with the "missing movie scanner" plugin
2020-02-08 20:39:16	fritsch	which files are not found and check on the scraper site itself how to properly rename it
2020-02-08 20:39:41	fritsch	as said above there is no AI involved, it's just regex and webservices that are queried
2020-02-08 20:40:12	K-tel	well, my music video folder has folders in them by artist name, and under each artist are files, usually artist - song title.
2020-02-08 20:40:29	pragmaticenigma	K-tel, refusing to read the documentation still? https://kodi.wiki/view/Music_videos
2020-02-08 20:40:36	TeamKodi	[unknown] then, there is a configure tab for the scraper as shown here ^^
2020-02-08 20:41:05	fritsch	pragmaticenigma: I think, the lesson is learned :-) let's be productive and forgiving again
2020-02-08 20:41:13	K-tel	looks like my files under music videos should be showing up
2020-02-08 20:41:51	fritsch	you need to tell the scraper in its settings: videos are in separate folders
2020-02-08 20:42:06	fritsch	and compare with the link pragmaticenigma has just posted
2020-02-08 20:42:12	K-tel	so music videos content doesn't automatically check subfolders?
2020-02-08 20:42:17	fritsch	if issue persists: debuglog is mandatory
2020-02-08 20:42:22	fritsch	K-tel: it will, but:
2020-02-08 20:42:43	fritsch	some users have all movie files in one folder
2020-02-08 20:42:50	fritsch	others have a separate folder name for the movie
2020-02-08 20:42:58	fritsch	therefore kodi has a scraper setting for that
2020-02-08 20:43:02	fritsch	please check the documentation
2020-02-08 20:43:29	K-tel	I've read the documentation, my understanding was that default was to check subfolders.
2020-02-08 20:43:48	fritsch	you really read all the three links we gave you?
2020-02-08 20:44:05	fritsch	so, if it does not work -> post your debuglog
2020-02-08 20:45:55	K-tel	when I click on music videos, it just shows me the shares I added.  If I try to back out of that, it just shows me the options for movies or music....but I want music videos.  I'm just completely confused at why this is navigating this way, this doesn't seem to match what you suggest or what the documentation shows at all, and I still don't know how to get a debuglog out of a firestick or where you want me to send it which I mentioned
2020-02-08 20:45:55	K-tel	earlier.
2020-02-08 20:46:19	pragmaticenigma	There is a toggle there K-tel ... "Scan recursively" if that isn't "on" it won't look through subfolders
2020-02-08 20:46:32	K-tel	That's on by default.
2020-02-08 20:46:47	fritsch	there are two modes in kodi file mode and scraped mode (if you want to call it that way)
2020-02-08 20:47:19	fritsch	and for all file content to be come scraped content, a content type has to be set, configured and scanned
2020-02-08 20:47:52	fritsch	for the debuglog you were given a wiki link already
2020-02-08 20:48:24	fritsch	https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy

2020-02-08 21:02:53	pragmaticenigma	then translate what you learned to the other, more harder to use device
2020-02-08 21:03:34	daftykins	there's really no difference in user interaction, just obviously someone who doesn't understand Kodi's paradigms and thought they could troll the answers out of us instead of have to read

2020-02-08 21:04:49	fritsch	in fact
2020-02-08 21:04:54	fritsch	not sure what to say
2020-02-08 21:05:13	fritsch	I am in this channel for more than 9 years ...
2020-02-08 21:05:22	fritsch	I smell a layer 8 issue when I see it :-)
2020-02-08 21:05:50	fritsch	should have kick banned him after that "asshole" word, but thought yeah - he might not have gotten my humor
2020-02-08 21:05:58	fritsch	therefore waited a bit and tried my very best
2020-02-08 21:06:37	fritsch	It's a trend of our times, if thinks don't work with first click, one blames the solution, rather than oneself ...
2020-02-08 21:07:21	fritsch	s/thinks/things/ :-)
2020-02-08 21:09:40	pragmaticenigma	what i found more annoying is that they claim to be a helpdesk person...
2020-02-08 21:10:07	pragmaticenigma	if the users are blaming the devs, and the devs are blaming the users... and you're their intermediary... guess what... you're the problem
2020-02-08 21:11:20	fritsch	:-)
2020-02-08 21:11:24	fritsch	I thought exactly the same
2020-02-08 21:11:32	fritsch	but stepped on my tongue
2020-02-08 21:11:45	pragmaticenigma	What put me off was the lack of information, especially if their are in a position of helping users/devs... they should know the first 3 things are "What platform, what OS and it's version, and what version of the application
2020-02-08 21:11:52	pragmaticenigma	?"
2020-02-08 21:11:56	}8]	users want spoon-feeding from devs, devs want users to come with pre-existing knowledge..
2020-02-08 21:12:03	fritsch	I still prefer these to the group of: I code professional since more than 20 years and did not see such bad buggy code ever before ...
2020-02-08 21:12:29	fritsch	infact, I just wanted that he reads the three wiki links
2020-02-08 21:12:48	fritsch	he even made it to IRC, which is on a higher level than scrolling through the wiki
2020-02-08 21:13:09	fritsch	and if he works at a help desk, he exactly has to know: no help without proper logfiles, way to reproduce
2020-02-08 21:13:15	pragmaticenigma	They're a frequent visitor of many channels fritsch ... they probably searched alis frist
2020-02-08 21:13:18	fritsch	he disqualified himself when entering this channel
2020-02-08 21:15:10	}8]	its not rocket science to understand that working against the people you're asking help from will likely get you nowhere. answer the questions, provide the requested material, no too difficult
2020-02-08 21:15:46	fritsch	some users still think that we get money for hacking kodi
2020-02-08 21:16:11	fritsch	that mostly all of us have long "outlived" university, got graduaded and not have a 50 hours week job + familiy :-)
2020-02-08 21:16:15	fritsch	no one believes
2020-02-08 21:16:41	fritsch	s/not/now/ :-)
2020-02-08 21:16:44	fritsch	too tired to type
2020-02-08 21:16:51	}8]	wait, you life exists beyond kodi source and a compiler?!?!?!?!  :o
2020-02-08 21:16:58	fritsch	hehehe
2020-02-08 21:17:01	}8]	how can that be?! ;)
2020-02-08 21:17:16	fritsch	yeah, we heavily miss some fresh blood
2020-02-08 21:17:26	fritsch	some platforms just have 1 developer left
2020-02-08 21:18:49	}8]	it seems like most people fall into 1 of 2 categories. they have the time to help but lack the coding ability. or have the coding ability but no time to give.
2020-02-08 21:20:27	pragmaticenigma	kodi is compiled???? :-P
2020-02-08 21:20:46	fritsch	isn't it a nodejs application?
2020-02-08 21:20:54	pragmaticenigma	I thought it was all written in Python now
2020-02-08 21:20:59	pragmaticenigma	:-D
2020-02-08 21:21:10	daftykins	EOL Python
2020-02-08 21:21:11	daftykins	:o
2020-02-08 21:21:23	}8]	heh
2020-02-08 21:21:23	fritsch	hehe, don't tell anyone
2020-02-08 21:21:40	fritsch	imagine google playstore would realize that we add an enire python environment into an app
2020-02-08 21:21:56	fritsch	(android's sandboxing - not kodi's ;-) works quite well)
2020-02-08 21:22:43	pragmaticenigma	I'm sure google is aware it's in there
2020-02-08 21:23:51	fritsch	jep, for sure

2020-02-08 21:24:49	}8]	how much of py2 -> py3 is just module & function name changes vs. actual changes that require re-writing pieces of code?  i know theres a ton of the former but unsure about the latter
2020-02-08 21:25:05	fritsch	also tons
2020-02-08 21:25:06	}8]	as it pertains to kodi that is, no in general
2020-02-08 21:25:07	fritsch	:-)
2020-02-08 21:25:11	pragmaticenigma	}8], there's a lot more ... specifically in string handling
2020-02-08 21:25:19	fritsch	especially on the "closed OSs" like windows
2020-02-08 21:25:32	fritsch	string handling was the obvious
2020-02-08 21:25:38	fritsch	everybody has known
2020-02-08 21:25:48	fritsch	but under the hood, the "LOCK"
2020-02-08 21:25:52	fritsch	if you know what I am talking about
2020-02-08 21:26:04	pragmaticenigma	string handling is what made it hard for me to move to python3
2020-02-08 21:26:06	fritsch	windows was a huge issue and we just got it going very late in the cycle
2020-02-08 21:26:13	pragmaticenigma	mostly from not understanding what was going on
2020-02-08 21:26:42	fritsch	there is a python3 branch

2020-04-11 20:38:41	daftykins	which version and OS are you trying from?
2020-04-11 20:39:10	TeamKodi	[unknown] it's a binary addon
2020-04-11 20:39:17	TeamKodi	[unknown] you have to compile it, if you don't use kodi's ppa
2020-04-11 20:39:26	captainchris	ok 
2020-04-11 20:40:17	captainchris	daftykins: kodi 18.6 leaia on linux 
2020-04-11 20:40:56	daftykins	"Linux" is a kernel, not a distribution
2020-04-11 20:41:12	captainchris	archlinux 
2020-04-11 20:41:25	captainchris	you tell me OS 
2020-04-11 20:42:26	TeamKodi	[unknown] whatever - same procedure - build it from source
2020-04-11 20:42:34	TeamKodi	[unknown] aur might have some packages you can use
2020-04-11 20:42:39	daftykins	'arch' is the answer yes

2020-04-11 20:47:10	TeamKodi	[unknown] for now: apt-get build-dep kodi - and I can start developing. No need for arch
2020-04-11 20:48:03	captainchris	Ok good

2020-04-11 21:30:13	TeamKodi	[lrusak] does tvheadend support timeshift?
